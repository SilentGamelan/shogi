Dear lord, dealing with indexing issues is a right royal pain in the arse.

After finally getting back and knuckling down to making some vaguely structured progress, have spent the last two days beating my head on the keyboard trying to fix some helper functions:
`setUpPieces()`
 for translating Shogi Notation coordinates to playable board co-ordinates

`mirrorLayout()`
`notationToIndex()`

`indexToNotation()`


It's almost enough to go down the path of believing arrays begin at 1....
